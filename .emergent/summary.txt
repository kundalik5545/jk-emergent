The AI engineer's work involved a significant architectural transformation of a personal finance dashboard. Initially, the engineer focused on debugging and fixing environment configuration issues, primarily related to Clerk authentication keys ( vs ) and  for Prisma/PostgreSQL migration. An iterative process of fixing and re-running Prisma migrations and seed scripts was undertaken to adapt to the multi-user schema. Critical security flaws were addressed by implementing Clerk authentication across all API routes. Subsequently, the monolithic API route was refactored into modular, resource-specific routes. The core challenge then shifted to fixing the authentication redirect loop and ensuring authenticated users could access the dashboard, which involved correcting  integration, fine-tuning Clerk middleware, and resolving persistent environment variable loading issues. The work culminated in a fully functional authentication system redirecting logged-in users to the dashboard.

<product_requirements>
The application is a personal finance dashboard built with Next.js (App Router), JavaScript, and Prisma. Initially, it used SQLite, but is migrating to PostgreSQL.

**Implemented Features (prior to transformation):**
*   **Data Import:** Upload and parse Excel/CSV bank statements, mapping various columns.
*   **Transaction Management:** CRUD operations for transactions across multiple account types.
*   **Categorization:** CRUD for categories and subcategories, assignable to transactions.
*   **Filtering & Views:** Transactions filtered by date, category, account, description. Responsive UI with card/table views. Account totals displayed responsively.
*   **Transaction Export:** Functionality to export data to CSV and Excel.

**Pending/Future Requirements (Major Transformation):**
*   **Authentication:** Implement multi-user authentication using Clerk.
*   **Database Migration:** Migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL (Neon).
*   **Modular Architecture:** Restructure  into modular components and separate routes for dashboard, transactions, accounts, categories, and reports.
*   **Budgeting:** Set and track monthly budgets with notifications.
*   **Analytics & Charts:** Enhance existing charts and add new ones with various filters.
*   **Default Account:** Set a default account for new transactions.
*   **UI/UX:** Implement a left-side dashboard sidebar with dark mode and search.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully completed the foundational aspects of the major application transformation. The application now features robust multi-user authentication using Clerk, including dedicated sign-in/sign-up pages, a protected dashboard, and proper redirection for authenticated users. The database has been successfully migrated to PostgreSQL (Neon) and is populated with demo data. Crucially, all backend API routes have been secured with Clerk authentication, and the monolithic  has been refactored into modular, resource-specific API files (, , , ) for improved maintainability.

On the frontend, the application has a professional landing page for unauthenticated users, and authenticated users are correctly redirected to a modular dashboard structure. Core dashboard pages (, , , ) are now correctly wrapped with the  component, providing consistent sidebar navigation. These pages have also been updated to connect to the new, secured, modular APIs to fetch real data, replacing previous mock data. The environment variable loading issues for Clerk keys and database URLs have been resolved, ensuring the application runs with the correct configurations.
